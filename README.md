## [strategy tree here: https://github.com/yancong222/SSD-LM-STanglab]

This folder contains scripts and modified code (Python, R, shell) written or adapted by Yan Cong starting in August 2021 at The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research.

There are five subfolders, each representing a different study. Each subfolder contains its own README file with a summary of the contents of that folder.
